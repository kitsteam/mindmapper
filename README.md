# TeamMapper

Mindmapping made simple: Host and create your own mindmaps. Share your mindmap sessions with your team and collaborate on mindmaps.

TeamMapper is based on mindmapp (https://github.com/cedoor/mindmapp , discontinued). In contrast to mindmapp, TeamMapper features shared mindmapping sessions for your team based on websockets.

## Features:

-   Host and create your own mindmaps
-   Set node images, colors and font properties.
-   Shortcuts
-   Import and export functionality (JSON, PDF, PNG...)
-   Mutli user support: Share your mindmap with friends and collegues. Work at the same time on the same mindmap!
-   By default, mindmaps are deleted after 30 days to ensure GDPR compliancy.

## Getting started

### Development

-   Start up app necessary services

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate
    ```

-   Start frontend and backend at once

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app sh
    # Inside docker container, you execute the following
    npm --prefix teammapper-backend run dev
    ```

    or start frontend and backend separately

    ```bash
    # Open to terminal session on your host machine

    # I first terminal session
    docker-compose exec app npm --prefix teammapper-backend start

    # I second terminal session
    docker-compose exec app npm --prefix teammapper-frontend start
    ```

-   Visit the frontend in http://localhost:4200

### Test

-   Create a test database

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec postgres createdb -e -U teammapper-user -W teammapper-backend-test
    ```

-   Execute the tests

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app npm -prefix teammapper-backend run test:e2e
    ```

### Production

-   Generate self-signed ssl sertificate for the postgres server on the host machine; the generated files are mounted into the docker container

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ./ca
    openssl req -new -text -passout pass:abcd -subj /CN=localhost -out ./ca/server.req -keyout ./ca/privkey.pem
    openssl rsa -in ./ca/privkey.pem -passin pass:abcd -out ./ca/server.key
    openssl req -x509 -in ./ca/server.req -text -key ./ca/server.key -out ./ca/server.crt
    chmod 600 ./ca/server.key
    test $(uname -s) = Linux && chown 70 ./ca/server.key
    ```

-   Duplicate and rename `.env.default`

    ```bash
    cp .env.default .env.prod
    ```

-   Adjust all configs in `.env.prod`, e.g. database settings, ports, disable ssl env vars if necessary

-   Start everything at once (including a forced build):

    ```bash
    docker-compose --file docker-compose-prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d --build --force-recreate
    ```

-   Go to `http://localhost` to open up teammapper
- Optional:

    If you want to make sure, to include the most recent updates, run first:

    ```bash
    docker-compose --file docker-compose-prod.yml --env-file .env.prod build --no-cache
    ```

    then:

    ```bash
    docker-compose --file docker-compose-prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d --force-recreate
    ```

    If you want to remove old data, including cached node packages and stored databases (DANGER!):

    ```bash
    docker-compose --file docker-compose-prod.yml --env-file .env.prod down -v
    ```
    
    If you want to run prod migrations (again):
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app_prod npm -prefix teammapper-backend run typeorm:prod:migrate
    ```

### Further details

-   Once this docker volume is initialized after the first `docker-compose up`, the database-related variables in `.env.prod` will not have any effect; please have this in mind => you will then need to setup your database manually

### Content Security Policy

You can use a content security policy to restrict which resources are being loaded. The app is completely self contained, so you can use quite strict policies. For nginx, this would look like this:

```
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' ws: wss:; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';" always;
```
